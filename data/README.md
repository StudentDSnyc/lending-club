####Abstract

Peer-to-peer lending companies provide online platforms that can quickly pair borrowers seeking a loan with investors willing to fund the loan at an attractive rate. Since these loans are unsecured and companies creating the market generally do not invest their own capital, neither borrowers nor companies assume any risk. Entire credit risk is born by investors. Literature shows that credit risk depends upon borrower characteristics, loan terms and regional macroeconomic factors. To help investors identify unsecured loans likely to be fully paid, a machine learning algorithm was developed to forecast probability of full payment and probability of default. Training and input data consisted of historic loans’ data from Lending Club and state level macroeconomic data from government and organizational sources. A logistic regression was shown to provide optimal results, effectively sequestering high risk loans.
